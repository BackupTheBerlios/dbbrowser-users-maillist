<PRE>Hello,

I have been doing more work on DBBrowser lately.  I am hoping to have a
release with support for scripting using BeanShell, which can be found
at <A HREF="http://www.beanshell.org/.">http://www.beanshell.org/.</A>  This will add a lot of power and
flexibility to DBBrowser.   You will be able to create scripts that view
the database information, make decisions, and update information with
the power of a script.  I want to make the feature in such a way that
you can run the script interactively or export it as a beanshell script
that can be run outside of DBBrowser.  Such a tool has been on my own
personal wish list for a while now because it would make software
updates easier when complex database changes are involved.

I know that DBBrowser has a lot of users, but am am not in touch with
them much.  I do not know what they want or need.  Also, I don't have an
opportunity to ask their opinion about new ideas that I have for
DBBrowser.  Therefore, as part of moving the project to berlios.de, I
have created a user's mailing list.

For a while, the list will be very low-traffic.  Especially since I am
holding off on another release until I get BeanShell scripting working.

Since I have had contact with you concerning DBBrowser before, I am
hoping that you would be interested in participating.

Hope to hear from you soon,
--
